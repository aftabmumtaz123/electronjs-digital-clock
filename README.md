## Simple Digital Clock App with Electron (aftabmumtaz123)

This is a basic digital clock application built with Electron.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a digital clock on a desktop window, providing a convenient way to view the current time.

**Features:**

- **Digital Clock Display:** Shows the current time in a large, easy-to-read format.
- **Automatic Updates:** Updates the clock every second for accurate timekeeping.
- **Customizable Background (Optional):** Allows you to set a background image for the clock window (not included in this example).

**Technologies Used:**

- Electron.js: Creates the desktop application framework.
- HTML: Defines the structure of the clock display.
- CSS: Styles the clock elements (font, color, etc.).
- JavaScript: Updates the clock display automatically.

**How it Works:**

1. Electron.js creates a native desktop window.
2. The HTML code is loaded within the window, displaying the clock element.
3. CSS styles the clock appearance.
4. JavaScript retrieves the current time every second and updates the clock display dynamically.

**Building the App:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aftabmumtaz123/electronjs-digital-clock.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd electron-digital-clock
   npm install
   ```

3. **(Optional) Customize background image:**

   - Create an `img` folder within the project directory.
   - Place your desired background image file inside the `img` folder.
   - Modify the CSS in `index.html` to reference the image file path (e.g., `background-image: url('img/your-image.jpg');`).

4. **Start the app:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the Electron app with the digital clock display.

**Further Enhancements:**

- Add features like displaying the date or providing an option for user-defined time formats.
- Implement customization options for font style, color, or window size.

**License:**

(Consider adding a license to your project, such as MIT or Apache. This helps clarify how others can use and distribute your code.)

I hope this README file provides clear instructions for building and using your Electron digital clock app!
